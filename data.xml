  <!-- ## Description & History -->

  <!-- The description is a simple short block to describe your company or studio. Be brief. -->
  <description>
    We are Ripe Render games.
  </description>

  <!--
    Tell your story with the `<history>` tag.

    You have two possibilities here.

    - Use an `<histories>` block like in the example.
    - Or use a single `<history>` block if you don't have much to say.

    You can't have both.

    Example of a single block:

    ```xml
    <history>
      Hello, world.
    </history>
    ```
  -->
  <histories>
    <history>
      <header>Built with presskit.html</header>
      <text>This presskit is generated by presskit.html, a tool created by Pixelnest Studio.</text>
    </history>
    <history>
      <header>Free and Open Source</header>
      <text>Find presskit.html on https://github.com/pixelnest/presskit.html</text>
    </history>
  </histories>

  <!-- ## Trailers -->

  <!--
    Add your videos. Because we are in the `<company>` page, try to be representative of all the products of your company.

    You can use YouTube and/or Vimeo. Only one is needed, and only one is recommended.

    Don't put the full link: just the ID is necessary.

    If you want to provide a link to download the video, add this tag in `<trailer>`:

    ```
    <download>https://example.com/video.mp4</download>
    ```
  -->
  <trailers>
    <trailer>
      <name>Example from YouTube. Don't give a full link: the ID is enough</name>
      <youtube>er416Ad3R1g</youtube>
    </trailer>
    <trailer>
      <name>Example from both YouTube and Vimeo</name>
      <youtube>YH3c1QZzRK4</youtube>
      <vimeo>108650530</vimeo>
    </trailer>

    <!--
      You can also add a video link without YouTube or Vimeo.

      In this case, only a sentence will be shown, along with a download link.
    -->

  <!-- ## Awards, quotes & links -->

  <!--
    You got awards? Great! Put them here.

    But don't add too much here: this is your company page, not a product one.
  -->

  <!-- ## Team & Contacts -->

  <!--
    This is for your people.

    Add yourself, of course, but also your **frequent** collaborators for example.

    If a collaborator has only worked on one product, add her/him on this product page instead.

    The `<role>` tag can be anything you want. But we recommend to, at least, put the company name for the founders/employees. This will distinguish this person from the external collaborators.

    The `<website>` tag is optional.
